# UW-Madison-CS300-Program-3

Introduction

This program involves the design, implementation, and testing of a simplified version for a public library management system named Book Library. We distinguish two users for this application: (i) the subscriber who can borrow books, and (ii) the librarian who is responsible for managing the books in the library and helping the library subscribers to check out or return books. Further display options are also available.
